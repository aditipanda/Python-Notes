import seaborn as sns <br>
color = sns.color_palette() - This returns a list of colors or a continuous colormap defining a palette. <br>

**Shell or Command Shell** - A command line interface to your computer. It can be used to: <br>
- start and stop processes that run programs <br>
- create and delete files and directories (a.k.a folders)  <br>
- set environment variables  <br>
- manage processes and process resources  <br>
- automate tasks.

Windows - cmd, power shell, Unix - bash, MacOS - tcsh.

**IPython** - A powerful toolkit with an interactive python shell + a Jupyter Kernel.
- IPython kernel helps with displaying plots that are outputs of jupyter code cells. It is designed to work with matplotlib library.
- Before plotting anything, use the magic function %matplotlib to set up the inner workings of IPython with matplotlib.
- If we use the %matplotlib magic function without any parameter, then by default, the plot is shown using the default matplotlib backend - outside the notebook on a separate window.
- If we use %matplotlib inline, the plot is shown using the inline backend, which places it immediately below the code cell, and can be stored as part of the notebook document.

**Magic functions!** <br>
%matplotlib inline -
